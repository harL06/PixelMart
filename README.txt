This is just split into different folders.
The main stuff is all in /Website
The other folders are mainly to prove I made all the 3D models and assets from scratch.
You can just ignore like all of it if need be.
I also attached a video to display the parallax effect because on some computers it displays incorrectly.

Also you can use this to download the entire repositry:
